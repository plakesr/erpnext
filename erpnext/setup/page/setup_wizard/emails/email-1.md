Dear {{ fullname }},

Some tips on setting up ERPNext:

1. Try and make dummy cycles: Run your dummy quotes, invoices, payments, deliveries in the system so that you can get familiar with what ERPNext can do for you.
1. Data Import Tool: You can import bulk data into system using the data import tool: via **Setup > Data > Data Import Tool**.
1. Add more users via **Setup > Users and Permissions > User**.
1. If you are done with the testing and want to start fresh, you can delete your company and create a new one.

If you need help or are stuck, [head to the user forum](https://discuss.frappe.io) or [read the manual](https://manual.erpnext.com).

Best of luck!
